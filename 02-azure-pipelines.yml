# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

trigger:
  - main

# strategy:
#   matrix:
#     linux:
#       operatingSystem: "ubuntu-latest"
#     mac:
#       operatingSystem: "macos-latest"

pool:
  vmImage: "ubuntu-latest"

stages:
  - stage: Build
    jobs:
      - job: BuildJob
        steps:
          - bash: echo "Do the build"

  - stage: DevDeployment
    jobs:
      - deployment: DevDeploymentJob
        environment: Dev
        strategy:
          runOnce:
            deploy:
              steps:
                - script: echo deploy the Dev

  - stage: QADeployment
    jobs:
      - deployment: QADeploymentJob
        environment: QA
        strategy:
          runOnce:
