# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

trigger:
  - main

# strategy:
#   matrix:
#     linux:
#       operatingSystem: "ubuntu-latest"
#     mac:
#       operatingSystem: "macos-latest"

pool:
  vmImage: "ubuntu-latest"
